Right now we have a reasonably effective pipeline that scales nicely on our
local computer. However, for the sake of this course, we'll pretend that our
workflow actually takes significant computational resources and needs to be run
on a [HPC cluster][ref-hpc-cluster].

Normally, updating a workflow to run on a HPC cluster requires a lot of work.
Batch scripts need to be written, and you'll need to monitor and babysit the
status of each of your jobs. This is especially difficult if one batch job
depends on the output from another. Even moving from one cluster to another
(especially ones using a different scheduler) requires a large investment of
time and effort. Frequently most of the batch scripts need to be rewritten.

Snakemake does all of this for you. All details of running the pipeline on the
cluster are handled by Snakemake - this includes writing batch scripts,
submitting, and monitoring jobs. In this scenario, the role of the scheduler is
limited to ensuring each Snakemake rule is executed with the resources it needs.

We'll explore how to port our example Snakemake pipeline by example. Our current
Snakefile is shown below. If you have skipped the previous episode, or if your
current Snakefile does not match, then please update to the following code. If
you require a configuration file, you can use
`.solutions/reduce_duplication/config.yaml`.

~~~
#------------------------------------------------------------
# load the configuration
configfile: 'config.yaml'

INPUT_DIR = config['input_dir']
PLOT_DIR = config['plot_dir']
DAT_DIR = config['dat_dir']
RESULTS_FILE = config['results_file']
ARCHIVE_FILE = config['archive_file']

#------------------------------------------------------------
# Single file patterns
#
# Now define all the wildcard patterns that either depend on
# directory and file configuration, or are used more than once.

# Note the use of single curly braces for global variables
# and double curly braces for snakemake wildcards

# a single plot file
PLOT_FILE = f'{PLOT_DIR}{{book}}.png'

# a single dat file
DAT_FILE = f'{DAT_DIR}{{book}}.dat'

# a single input book
BOOK_FILE = f'{INPUT_DIR}{{book}}.txt'

#------------------------------------------------------------
# File lists
#
# Now we can use the single file patterns in conjunction with
# glob_wildcards and expand to build the lists of all expected files.

# the list of book names
BOOK_NAMES = glob_wildcards(BOOK_FILE).book

# The list of all dat files
ALL_DATS = expand(DAT_FILE, book=BOOK_NAMES)

# The list of all plot files
ALL_PLOTS = expand(PLOT_FILE, book=BOOK_NAMES)

#------------------------------------------------------------
# Rules
#
# Note that when using this pattern, it is rare for a rule to
# define filename patterns directly. Nearly all inputs and outputs
# can be specified using the existing global variables.

# pseudo-rule that tries to build everything.
# Just add all the final outputs that you want built.
rule all:
    input: ARCHIVE_FILE

# Generate summary table
rule zipf_test:
    input:
        cmd='zipf_test.py',
        dats=ALL_DATS
    output: RESULTS_FILE
    # This shell command only contains wildcards, so it does not
    # require an f-string or double curly braces.
    shell:  'python {input.cmd} {input.dats} > {output}'

# delete everything so we can re-run things
# This rules uses an f-string and single curly braces since all values
# are global variables rather than wildcards.
rule clean:
    shell: f'rm -rf {DAT_DIR} {PLOT_DIR} {RESULTS_FILE} {ARCHIVE_FILE}'

# Count words in one of the books
rule count_words:
    input:
        cmd='wordcount.py',
        book=BOOK_FILE
    output: DAT_FILE
    shell: 'python {input.cmd} {input.book} {output}'

# plot one word count dat file
rule make_plot:
    input:
        cmd='plotcount.py',
        dat=DAT_FILE
    output: PLOT_FILE
    shell: 'python {input.cmd} {input.dat} {output}'

# create an archive with all results
rule create_archive:
    input: RESULTS_FILE, ALL_DATS, ALL_PLOTS
    output: ARCHIVE_FILE
    shell: 'tar -czvf {output} {input}'

To run Snakemake on a cluster, we need to tell it how it to submit jobs. This is
done using the `--cluster` argument. In this configuration, Snakemake runs on
the cluster login node and submits jobs. Each cluster job executes a single rule
and then exits. Snakemake detects the creation of output files, and submits new
jobs (rules) once their dependencies are created. Snakemake has many options
available to fine-tune the interactions with the scheduler, including resource
requests, and the maximum number of jobs to submit at any time. We will explore
the essential options here.

## Transferring our workflow

The first step will be to transfer our files to the cluster and log
on via SSH.

> ## Please Follow Your System Procedures
>
> Generic advice for transferring files and logging on to a HPC cluster is given
> here. Please follow your system's own user guidelines. If your HPC system
> allows graphical desktops, you could run a browser on the login node and
> download the code samples for this workshop directly to the cluster.
>
> The essential thing is to be logged into the cluster login node, with your
> Snakefile and other data files available.
{:.callout}

~~~
snakemake clean
tar -czvf pipeline.tar.gz .
# transfer the pipeline via scp
scp pipeline.tar.gz yourUsername@pearcey-login.hpc.csiro.au
# log on to the cluster
ssh -X yourUsername@pearcey-login.hpc.csiro.au
~~~
{:.language-bash}

At this point we've archived our entire pipeline, sent it to the cluster, and
logged on. Let's create a folder for our pipeline and unpack it there:

~~~
mkdir pipeline
mv pipeline.tar.gz pipeline
cd pipeline
tar -xvzf pipeline.tar.gz
~~~
{:.language-bash}

> ## CSIRO Clusters
>
> On the CSIRO Pearcey system, snakemake and all required Python packages are
> available in the `python/3.6.1` module. Load it with:
>
> ~~~
> module load python/3.6.1
> ~~~
> {:.language-bash}
{:.callout}

If Snakemake and Python are not already installed on your cluster, you can
install them using the following commands:

~~~
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b
echo 'export PATH=~/miniconda3/bin:~/.local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
conda install -y matplotlib numpy graphviz
pip install --user snakemake
~~~
{:.language-bash}

Assuming you've transferred your files and everything is set to go, the command
`snakemake -n` should work without errors.

## Cluster configuration with `cluster.yaml`

Snakemake uses a YAML-formatted configuration file to retrieve cluster
submission parameters (JSON is also supported, but not shown here). An example
(using SLURM) is shown below.

~~~
__default__:
    time: 0:5:0
    mem: 1G

count_words:
    time: 0:10:0
    mem: 2G
~~~
{:.language-yaml}

This file has several components. The values under `__default__` represent a set
of default configuration values that will be used for all rules. The defaults
won't always be perfect, however - chances are some rules may need to run with
non-default amounts of memory, cores, or time limits. We are using the
`count_words` rule as an example of this.

This is sufficient configuration for these exercises. For more information,
please consult the [Cluster Configuration][cluster-config-docs] documentation.

## Local rule execution

Some Snakemake rules perform trivial tasks where job submission might be
overkill (i.e. less than 1 minute worth of compute time). It would be a better
idea to have these rules execute locally (i.e. where the `snakemake` command is
run) instead of as a job. Snakemake lets you indicate which rules should always
run locally with the `localrules` keyword. Let's define `all`, `clean`, and
`make_archive` as local rules near the top of our `Snakefile` (in the example
code we added this line just before the `all` rule).

~~~
localrules: all, clean, make_archive
~~~
{:.language-python}

## Running our workflow on the cluster

Ok, time for the moment we've all been waiting for - let's run our workflow on
the cluster. To run our Snakefile, we'll run the following command:

~~~
snakemake --jobs 100 --cluster-config cluster.yaml --cluster "sbatch --mem={cluster.mem} --time {cluster.time} --cpus-per-task {threads}"
~~~
{:.language-bash}

> ## Job submission options will vary
>
> Some HPC systems require additional options when submitting jobs, such as an
> account or partitiion name. Please consult your system guidelines for the
> additional arguments.
>
{:.callout}

While things execute, you may wish to SSH to the cluster in another window so
you can watch the pipeline's progress with `watch squeue -u $(whoami)`.

Now, let's dissect the command we just ran:

* **`--jobs 100`** - `--jobs` or `-j` no longer controls the number of cores
  when running on a cluster. Instead, it controls the maximum number of jobs
  that snakemake can submit at a time. This does not come into play here, but
  generally a sensible default is slightly below the maximum number of jobs you
  are allowed to have submitted at a time on your system.

* **`--cluster-config`** - This specifies the location of a configuration file
  to read cluster configuration values from. This should point to the
  `cluster.yaml` file we wrote earlier.

* **`--cluster`** - This is the submission command that should be used for the
  scheduler. Note that command flags that normally are put in batch scripts are
  put here (most schedulers allow you to add submission flags like this when
  submitting a job). The values come from our `--cluster-config` file. You can
  access individual values with `{cluster.propertyName}`. Note that we also use
  `{threads}` here.  When submitting jobs, Snakemake will use the current value
  of `threads` given in the Snakefile for each rule.

> ## Notes on `$PATH`
>
> As with any cluster jobs, jobs started by Snakemake need to have the commands
> they are running on `$PATH`. For some schedulers (SLURM), no modifications
> are necessary - variables are passed to the jobs by default. You just need to
> load all the required environment modules prior to running Snakemake.
{:.callout}

> ## Dealing with Busy Systems
>
> When some clusters are busy, there may be a delay between when a job completes
> and when the output file appears on the file system being monitored by
> Snakemake. If this delay is too long, Snakemake will decide that the rule has
> failed. If this appears to be happening, you can instruct Snakemake to wait
> longer with the `--latency-wait` argument:
>
> ~~~
> snakemake --latency-wait 60 --jobs 100 --cluster-config cluster.yaml --cluster "sbatch --mem={cluster.mem} --time {cluster.time} --cpus-per-task {threads}"
> ~~~
> {:.language-bash}
>
> The value is a wait time in seconds.
{:.callout}

> ## Submitting a workflow with nohup
>
> `nohup some_command &` runs a command in the background and lets it keep
> running if you log off. Try running the pipeline in cluster mode using
> `nohup` (run `snakemake clean` beforehand).
>
> Where does the Snakemake log go to?
>
> Why might this technique be useful?
>
> You can kill the running Snakemake process with `killall snakemake`.
> Notice that if you try to run Snakemake again, it says the directory is locked.
> You can unlock the directory with `snakemake --unlock`.
{: .challenge}

> ## Running Snakemake itself as a batch job
>
> Can we also submit the `snakemake --cluster` pipeline as a batch job?
>
> Is this a good idea? What are some problems of this approach?
